Python script to convert m4a's to mp3's in bulk

Usage:

 1. Run `python convert.py` in folder with m4as you want converted
 2. wait
 3. converted mp3s should be there when done


**REQUIRES:**  
ffmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)  
pydub `pip install pydub`

Tested to work with webm also. Just replace extension on line 6 and 24.
In theory it should also work with any other file type pydub allows.
